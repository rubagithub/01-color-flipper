# Color Flipper Project

This simple web application allows you to change the background color by clicking a button. There are two versions available: one with predefined colors and another with random hex colors.

## Files

- `index.html`: HTML file for the simple color flipper.
- `hex.html`: HTML file for the hex color flipper.
- `app.js`: JavaScript file for the simple color flipper.
- `hex.js`: JavaScript file for the hex color flipper.
- `styles.css`: CSS file containing styles for both HTML files.
